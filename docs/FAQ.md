## Arduino Nano/Uno/Mega is not detected

When you run [`arduino-cli board list`][arduino cli board list], your board doesn't show up. Possible causes:

- Your board is a cheaper derivative, or
- It's a board, such the classic Nano, that uses a USB to serial converter like FTDI FT232 or CH340. These chips always
  report the same USB VID/PID to the operating system, so the only thing we know is that the board mounts that specific
  USB2Serial chip, but we donâ€™t know which board that chip is on.

## What's the FQBN string?

For a deeper understanding of how FQBN works, you should understand the [Arduino platform specification][0].

## How to set multiple board options?

Additional board options have to be separated by commas (instead of colon):

`$ arduino-cli compile --fqbn "esp8266:esp8266:generic:xtal=160,baud=57600" TestSketch`

## Where is the Serial Monitor?

The serial monitor is available through the [monitor command][monitor command]. By the way, the functionality provided
by this command is very limited and you may want to look for other tools if you need more advanced functionality.

There are many excellent serial terminals to chose from. On Linux or macOS, you may already have [screen][screen]
installed. On Windows, a good choice for command line usage is Plink, included with [PuTTY][putty].

## Additional assistance

If your question wasn't answered, feel free to ask on [Arduino CLI's forum board][1].
