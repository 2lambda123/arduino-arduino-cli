`arduino-cli` supports command-line completion (also known as *tab completion*) for basic commands.
Currently only `bash`, `zsh`, `fish` shells are supported

### Before you start
In order to generate the file required to make the completion work you have to [install](installation.md) Arduino CLI first.

### Generate the completion file
To generate the completion file you can use `arduino-cli completion [bash|zsh|fish] [--no-descriptions]`.
By default this command will print on the standard output (the shell window) the content of the completion file. To save to an actual file use the `>` redirect symbol.

### Bash
Use `arduino-cli completion bash > arduino-cli.sh` to generate the completion file.
At this point you can move that file in `/etc/bash_completion.d/` (root access is required) with `sudo mv arduino-cli.sh /etc/bash_completion.d/`.

A not recommended alternative is to source the completion file in `.bashrc`.

Remember to open a new shell to test the functionality

### Zsh
Use `arduino-cli completion zsh > _arduino-cli` to generate the completion file.
At this point you can place the file in a directory listed in your `fpath` if you have already created a directory to store your completion.

Or if you want you can create a directory, add it to your `fpath` and copy the file in it:

1. `mkdir ~/completion_zsh`
2. add `fpath=($HOME/completion_zsh $fpath)` at the beginning of your `.zshrc` file
3. `mv _arduino-cli ~/completion_zsh/`

Remember to open a new shell to test the functionality

*N.B.*
The Zsh completion is working with [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) but not with [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) (the zsh completion system is working in a different way than classic zsh). But hopefully it will be fixed in the future

### Fish
Use `arduino-cli completion fish > arduino-cli.fish` to generate the completion file.
At this point you can place the file in `~/.config/fish/completions` as stated in the [official documentation](http://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#where-to-put-completions).
Remember to create the directory if it's not already there `mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions/` and then place the completion file in there with `mv arduino-cli.fish ~/.config/fish/completions/`

Remember to open a new shell to test the functionality

#### Disabling command and flag descriptions
By default fish completion has command and flag description enabled by default. If you want to disable this behaviour you can simply pass the `--no-descriptions` flag when calling `completion` command and the generated file will not have descriptions

*N.B.*
This flag is not compatible with bash or zsh
